# MultipleChoiceTest

# Description:
# The MultipleChoiceTest is a test that begins by showing the user a list of variables and their value. The test then asks four questions using the varibales given.
# The user has two attempts to answer the questions correct. The loop for the second attempt ONLY cycles through the incorrectly answered questions. 

# Purpose of my project: 
# My goal was to creat a code that would cycle through a list once, score teh information, then cycle back to ONLY the questions that were answered wrong.
# I also wanted the second cylce to add points if the second attempe was correct. 
# Finally, I wanted the loop to only cycle through twice before printing the score.
